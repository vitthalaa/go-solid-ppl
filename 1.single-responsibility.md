# Single Responsibility Principle 
A class should have only one reason to change. 

In other words, each class should have only one responsibility or job to do.

### Problem

Consider following example:

```go
type Car struct {
    Name  string
    Color string
}

type CarService struct{}

func (s *CarService) CreateCar(name string, color string) {
    // Create a new car
    car := &Car{
        Name:  name,
        Color: color,
    }
    
    // Save the car to the database
    s.saveToDatabase(car)
    
    // Send email notification
    s.sendNotification(car)
}

func (s *CarService) saveToDatabase(car *Car) {
    // Save the car to the database
    fmt.Printf("Saving car %s...\n", car.Name)
}

func (s *CarService) sendNotification(car *Car) {
    // Send email notification
    fmt.Printf("Sending notification about car %s...\n", car.Name)
}

func main() {
    service := &CarService{}
    
    // Create a new car
    service.CreateCar("Toyota Camry", "red")
}
```

In this example, the `CarService` struct represents a service for creating new cars. 
The `CreateCar` method creates a new car, saves it to the database, and sends an email notification. 
This violates the Single Responsibility Principle because the `CarService` class is responsible for multiple tasks.

If the requirements change and we no longer need to send an email notification when a new car is created, 
we would need to modify the `CarService` class to remove the `sendNotification` method. 
This violates the Single Responsibility Principle because we are modifying a class for a reason other than its original responsibility. 

To avoid this, we should separate the tasks into separate classes, so that each class has a single responsibility.

### Solution

```go
type Car struct {
    Name  string
    Color string
}

type CarDB struct{}

func (db *CarDB) Save(car *Car) {
    // Save the car to the database
    fmt.Printf("Saving car %s...\n", car.Name)
}

type CarService struct {
    db *CarDB
}

func (s *CarService) CreateCar(name string, color string) {
    // Create a new car
    car := &Car{
        Name:  name,
        Color: color,
    }
    
    // Save the car to the database
    s.db.Save(car)
}

func main() {
    db := &CarDB{}
    service := &CarService{db: db}
    
    // Create a new car
    service.CreateCar("Toyota Camry", "red")
}
```

In this example, the `Car` struct represents a car with a name and a color. 
The `CarDB` struct represents a database for storing cars, and the Save method saves a car to the database. 
The `CarService` struct represents a service for creating new cars, 
and the `CreateCar` method creates a new car and saves it to the database using the `CarDB` object.

This example demonstrates the Single Responsibility Principle because 
each class (`Car`, `CarDB`, and `CarService`) has only one responsibility or job to do. 

The `Car` struct represents a car, the `CarDB` struct represents a database, 
and the `CarService` struct represents a service for creating new cars. 
Each class is responsible for a single task, 
and if any of these tasks change, only the relevant class needs to be modified.
