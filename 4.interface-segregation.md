# Interface Segregation Principle

Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use. 

This means that interfaces should be as small and specific as possible.

### Problem

```go
type Printer interface {
    Print()
    Scan()
    Fax()
}

type LaserPrinter struct{}

func (p *LaserPrinter) Print() {
    // Print a document
    fmt.Println("Printing a document...")
}

func (p *LaserPrinter) Scan() {
    // Scan a document
    fmt.Println("Scanning a document...")
}

func (p *LaserPrinter) Fax() {
    // Fax a document
    fmt.Println("Faxing a document...")
}

func main() {
    // Create a new LaserPrinter
    printer := &LaserPrinter{}

    // Print a document
    printer.Print()

    // Scan a document
    printer.Scan()

    // Fax a document
    printer.Fax()
}


```

In this example, the `Printer` interface includes three methods: `Print`, `Scan`, and `Fax`. 
The `LaserPrinter` struct implements all three methods. 
This violates the Interface Segregation Principle because not all printers 
necessarily support scanning or faxing. 

For example, a simple inkjet printer might only support printing and not scanning or faxing. 
By including all three methods in the Printer interface, we force all implementations of the 
interface to provide implementations for methods that might not be relevant to them.


To avoid violating the Interface Segregation Principle, we should separate the methods into separate interfaces. 
For example, we could define a `Printable` interface for printers that support printing, 
a `Scannable` interface for printers that support scanning, 
and a `Faxable` interface for printers that support faxing. 

Then we could have separate implementations of these interfaces for each type of printer, 
and only include the interfaces that are relevant to a particular printer. 

This would allow us to create more flexible and adaptable code that is more easily extensible in the future.


### Solution

```go
type Printable interface {
    Print()
}

type Scannable interface {
    Scan()
}

type Faxable interface {
    Fax()
}

type LaserPrinter struct{}

func (p *LaserPrinter) Print() {
    // Print a document
    fmt.Println("Printing a document...")
}

func main() {
    // Create a new LaserPrinter
    printer := &LaserPrinter{}

    // Print a document
    printer.Print()
}
```

In this example, we have separated the Printer interface into three separate interfaces: 
`Printable`, `Scannable`, and `Faxable`. 

We have also created a separate implementation of each interface for the `LaserPrinter` struct. 
Since the `LaserPrinter` struct only supports printing, we have only implemented the `Print` method for the `Printable` interface.

This follows the Interface Segregation Principle because we have separated the methods into smaller, 
more focused interfaces that are easier to implement and maintain.

We have also created separate implementations of each interface for each type of printer, 
which allows us to add new types of printers and new methods without modifying existing code.
