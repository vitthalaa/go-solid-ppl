# Liskov Substitution Principle
Subtypes should be substitutable for their base types. 

In other words, you should be able to use a subclass wherever you can use its parent class.

### Problem
Consider following example

```go
type PaymentInstrument interface {
	Validate() error
	SendToPaymentGateway() error
}

type CreditCard struct {}

func (c *CreditCard) Validate() error {
    // credit card validation
}

func (c *CreditCard) SendToPaymentGateway() error {
    // send details to payment gateway
}

// A different area in our codebase where we process a payment might look something like this
func ProcessPayment(order interface{}, inst PaymentInstrument) error {
	err := inst.Validate()
	if err != nil {
	    return err	
    }
	
	err = inst.SendToPaymentGateway()
	if err != nil {
        return err
    }
	
	// do remaining order processing
	
	return nil
}

func main() {
    // Create a new CreditCard
    card := &CreditCard{}
	order := interface{}
    
	err := ProcessPayment(order, card)
}
```
In this example `PaymentInstrument` includes two methods: `Validate` and `SendToPaymentGateway`.
The `CreditCard` struct implements both methods. 
Similarly, we can have `DebitCard` struct which can have own implementation for both methods.

Somewhere in system we have `ProcessPayment` function which accepts `order` as some order details
and implementation of interface `PaymentInstrument`.
We can create instance of CreditCard and pass to `ProcessPayment` as `PaymentInstrument`.

At some point product team decide to introduce rewards payments 
where user can pay using his account rewards.

Here we can introduce `Rewards` struct which can implement `PaymentInstrument` as follows,
```go
type Rewards struct {}

func (r *Rewards) Validate() error {
    // rewards validation
}

func (r *Rewards) SendToPaymentGateway() error {
    // do nothing as rewards does not need to send to payment gateway
}

func main() {
    // Create a new Rewards
    rewards := &Rewards{}
    order := interface{}
    
    err := ProcessPayment(order, rewards)
}
```
Problem with this implementation is that we forced `Rewards` struct to implement `SendToPaymentGateway` 
which do nothing.

This is violating the Liskov Substitution Principle as `Rewards` struct 
is not proper substitution for `PaymentInstrument`.

### Solution

To avoid this violation of LSP, we can make `PaymentInstrument` substitutable by all payment methods.
We can replace `SendToPaymentGateway` method by `CollectPayment`. 

So that `CreditCard` or `DebitCard` can perform operation of collecting payment by sending details to payment gateway.
And `Rewards` can perform collecting payment operation on users account rewards.

Above example can be fixed as bellow,
```go
type PaymentInstrument interface {
	Validate() error
	CollectPayment() error
}

type CreditCard struct {}

func (c *CreditCard) Validate() error {
    // credit card validation
}

func (c *CreditCard) CollectPayment() error {
    // send details to payment gateway
}

type Rewards struct{}

func (r *Rewards) Validate() error {
    // rewards validation
}

func (r *Rewards) CollectPayment() error {
    // Debit rewards from user account
}

func ProcessPayment(order interface{}, inst PaymentInstrument) error {
    err := inst.Validate()
    if err != nil {
        return err
    }
    
    err = inst.CollectPayment()
    if err != nil {
        return err
    }
    
    // do remaining order processing
    
    return nil
}
```
