# Dependency Inversion Principle

High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Instead, they should depend on abstractions.

This means that you should depend on interfaces or abstract classes rather than concrete implementations.

### Problem

```go
type Database struct{}

func (db *Database) Save(data string) {
    fmt.Println("Saving data to database:", data)
}

type User struct{}

func (u *User) Create(username string) {
    db := &Database{}
    db.Save("Creating user with username " + username)
}

func main() {
    user := &User{}
    user.Create("john.doe")
}
```

In this example, we have a `Database` struct that provides a `Save()` method to save data to a database. 
We also have a `User` struct that provides a `Create()` method to create a new user in the database. 

However, the `User` struct creates a new instance of the `Database` struct inside its `Create()` method, 
violating the Dependency Inversion Principle.

The `User` struct should not be responsible for creating a `Database` object, 
as this creates a tight coupling between the two classes and makes it difficult to change the database implementation in the future. 

Instead, we should use dependency injection to provide the `User` struct with a `Database` object.

### Solution

Here's an updated version of the code that follows the Dependency Inversion Principle:
```go
type Database interface {
    Save(data string)
}

type MySQLDatabase struct{}

func (db *MySQLDatabase) Save(data string) {
    fmt.Println("Saving data to MySQL database:", data)
}

type User struct {
    database Database
}

func (u *User) Create(username string) {
    u.database.Save("Creating user with username " + username)
}

func main() {
    mysqlDb := &MySQLDatabase{}
    user := &User{database: mysqlDb}
    user.Create("john.doe")
}
```

In this updated version, we have introduced a `Database` interface that defines the `Save()` method. 
We have also created a `MySQLDatabase` struct that implements the `Database` interface 
and provides a `Save()` method to save data to a MySQL database.

We have modified the `User` struct to accept a `Database` object as a dependency through its constructor. 
This ensures that the `User` struct is not responsible for creating a `Database` object 
and follows the Dependency Inversion Principle.

In the `main()` function, we create a new `MySQLDatabase` object and pass it to the `User` struct when creating a new instance. 
This ensures that the `User` struct has a `Database` object to use when creating a new user.

By introducing an interface and using dependency injection, 
we have decoupled the `User` and `Database` classes and ensured that our code follows the Dependency Inversion Principle.
