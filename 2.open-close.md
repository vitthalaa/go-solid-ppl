# Open/Closed Principle 
A class should be open for extension but closed for modification. 

This means that you should be able to add new functionality to a class without modifying its existing code.

### Problem

Consider following example
```go
type Car struct {
    Name  string
    Color string
}

type CarService struct{}

func (s *CarService) CreateCar(name string, color string, dbType string) {
    // Create a new car
    car := &Car{
        Name:  name,
        Color: color,
    }

    // Save the car to the database
    if dbType == "MySQL" {
        s.saveToMySQL(car)
    } else if dbType == "Postgres" {
        s.saveToPostgres(car)
    } else {
        fmt.Println("Unsupported database type")
    }
}

func (s *CarService) saveToMySQL(car *Car) {
    // Save the car to a MySQL database
    fmt.Printf("Saving car %s to MySQL...\n", car.Name)
}

func (s *CarService) saveToPostgres(car *Car) {
    // Save the car to a Postgres database
    fmt.Printf("Saving car %s to Postgres...\n", car.Name)
}

func main() {
    service := &CarService{}

    // Create a new car and save it to MySQL
    service.CreateCar("Toyota Camry", "red", "MySQL")

    // Create another new car and save it to Postgres
    service.CreateCar("Honda Civic", "blue", "Postgres")
}
```

In this example, the `CarService` class represents a service for creating new cars. 
The `CreateCar` method creates a new car and saves it to a database based on the `dbType` argument. 
This violates the Open Closed Principle because the `CarService` class is not closed for modification. 

If we want to add support for a new type of database, 
we would need to modify the `CreateCar` method to include a new conditional statement. 
This violates the Open Closed Principle because we are modifying a class for a reason other than its original responsibility.

To avoid violating the Open Closed Principle, 
we should use abstractions and interfaces to make the code open for extension and closed for modification. 

For example, we could define a `CarDB` interface that includes a `Save` method, 
and create separate implementations of this interface for MySQL and Postgres databases. 
Then we could inject the appropriate implementation of the `CarDB` interface into the `CarService` class using dependency injection. 
This would allow us to add new types of databases without modifying the `CarService` class.

### Solution

```go
type Car struct {
    Name  string
    Color string
}

type CarDB interface {
    Save(car *Car)
}

type MySQLCarDB struct{}

func (db *MySQLCarDB) Save(car *Car) {
    // Save the car to a MySQL database
    fmt.Printf("Saving car %s to MySQL...\n", car.Name)
}

type PostgresCarDB struct{}

func (db *PostgresCarDB) Save(car *Car) {
    // Save the car to a Postgres database
    fmt.Printf("Saving car %s to Postgres...\n", car.Name)
}

type CarService struct {
    db CarDB
}

func (s *CarService) CreateCar(name string, color string) {
    // Create a new car
    car := &Car{
        Name:  name,
        Color: color,
    }

    // Save the car to the database
    s.db.Save(car)
}

func main() {
    // Create a new MySQL database and service
    mysqlDB := &MySQLCarDB{}
    service1 := &CarService{db: mysqlDB}

    // Create a new Postgres database and service
    postgresDB := &PostgresCarDB{}
    service2 := &CarService{db: postgresDB}

    // Create a new car and save it to MySQL
    service1.CreateCar("Toyota Camry", "red")

    // Create another new car and save it to Postgres
    service2.CreateCar("Honda Civic", "blue")
}
```

This example demonstrates the Open Closed Principle because 
the `CarService` class is open for extension but closed for modification. 
We can add new types of databases that implement the `CarDB` interface without modifying the `CarService` class. 

For example, we could create a new `SQLiteCarDB` struct that implements the `CarDB` interface, 
and use it with the existing `CarService` class without modifying the class. 
This allows us to add new functionality to the system without modifying existing code.
